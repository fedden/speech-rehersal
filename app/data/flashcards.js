I'm Leon, the best friend of the groom… For now.\n\nIt's an honour to be here."

My best mate is working with me. This will be fun.\" But three months later…\n* Pause\n* He was my manager.\n\nIf you take a look at Alex's CV, you'll notice it's written in size 72 bold font and just says the word \"Legend\"\n\nAnd it's over silly things like that, and in general it's no surprise that growing up, Alex and I argued a lot.\n\n* But I always felt that Alex has pushed me to see the world from a different point of view…\n* A view that is refreshingly…\n* Pause.\n* Moronic."

Unfortunately, Alex's mental age didn't…\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, Alex lived with me and my partner in London.\n\n* Naturally at the time, all work was remote, and we had this nook of the flat dedicated to office space. Nothing could go wrong.\n* So, there I was, trying to read papers, translate mathematical equations into code. And Alex was hard at work too:\n* Pause\n* Blaring out Talksport, sending memes, and shouting something about deals.\n\nI was trying to capture the tranquillity of an office, and Alex thought he was starring in The Wolf of Wall Street."

    back: "But towards the tail end of the pandemic, when things started to open up, something changed.\n\nThe thing about living with Alex, is that he tends to walk quite flat footed:\n\nAt 2 AM, I was used to hearing the sound: 'DOOF. DOOF. DOOF.'\nAlex, the hunter-gatherer, returns from another night out with a chicken wrap in hand.\nBut then… a new sound: 'tap tap tap.' It was delicate. It was graceful… It was quite stealthy, but it was… the unmistakable sound of a second set of footsteps.\n\nThat's when I knew—something weird was, literally, afoot…\nAlex had tricked someone into liking him.\n\nAnd not just anyone.\nA member of the opposite sex.\nAnd not just any member of the opposite sex…\nSomeone as bestowed with qualities as Alexandra."

Nobel Prizes have been given out for less.\n\nSo Congratulations to Mr and Mrs Reeves for raising such a fantastic daughter\n\n* And to Jeremy and Theresa….\n* Long pause\n* Well, you did your best with what you had to work with."

    back: "So, if I've ripped into Alex for being a bit crap, I would like to remind you all of my remit in this speech: Telling the truth.\n\nAnd, this truth extends further.\n\nI should highlight that I am also incredibly crap, and the crucial thing is, Alex has always suffered me.\n\nTo abbreviate decades, I've wasted his time, patience, money – and much else - yet to Alex's credit, he's always relaxed and is ready to go again.\n\nAlex is a true force of nature. Nothing gets him down - unless arsenal loses - and he's always been so confident and collected with everyone we meet."

    back: "[EMPHASIS ON TRUTH NOW]\nThe truth is, me and Alex were really tight growing up, and my feeling is that over time life has taken us down separate paths.\n\nAnd that's okay for me, because it's clear how brilliantly Alex and Alexandra have been in creating a life filled with adventure and happiness. Those joint steps that I heard at 2AM all those years ago have led them here today. And I am sure they will lead them onwards to a fulfilling and joyful married life.\n\nAlex, Alex… I love you both and I'm honoured to call you friends.\n\nAnd whilst I'm in no position to offer you advice, I simply wish that you enjoy yourselves and have enormous amounts of fun together.\n\nSo everyone, please join me in raising a glass, to the happy couple!"
